<h1>Abdul-Jalil's Top 5 Movies</h1>
<h2>5 of The Best Movies of All Time(in my very biased opinion)</h2>

<hr />

<h3>#5: Teen Titans: Trouble in Tokyo(Cartoon Network)</h3>
<p>After the mysterious Saiko-Tek attacks Jump City and destroys Titans Tower, the Teen Titans have no other choice but to track down this mysterious assailant to Tokyo and sniff him out. Things aren't as simple as that however, and the Titans find themselves unraveling a surprising twist, all the while facing homages to classic figures in Japanese culture, such as a Tokusatsu fighter and Godzilla. With all the cheesy jokes expected of superhero cartoons, blood-pumping actions, and tear-jerking scenes, Teen Titans: Trouble in Tokyo serves as the perfect send-off to the legenedary cartoon that grabbed the hearts of a generation.</p>

<h3>#4: Kimetsu No Yaiba(Demon Slayer): Mugen Train(Ufotable).</h3>
<p>Determined to master Sun-Breathing and continue his journey to cut down the Demon King Muzan and restore his sister's huamnity, Tanjiro Kamado boards a train with comrades Inosuke Hashibira and Zenitsu Agatsuma to seek the tutelage of Rengoku Kyojuro, the current Fire-Breathing Hashira, all the while going down a literal nightmarish trip down memory. With the simple, yet attention-grabbing plot, the lovable characters, and the breath-taking animation Ufotable is known for, Kimetsu No Yaiba: Mugen Train is everything Demon Slayer fans want wrapped up in one, gorgeous package.</p>

<h3>#3: Kung Fu Panda 2(DreamWorks).</h3>
<p>After taking down the dastardly Tai Lung and proving to the world and himself that he's worthy of the title of Dragon Warrior, Po is quickly thrusted into a new challenge as an attack on a nearby village leads him on a journey to a splintered past wrought with pain, loss, and a egotistical albino peacock trying desperately to avoid his destiny. Kung Fu Panda 2 stays true to the wacky, yet serious tone set by the first movie, builds upon the great action sequences, and marks off the second stepping stone in Po's journey to becoming the Dragon Warrior he was always meant to be.</p>

<h3>#2: Dragon Ball Super: Broly(Toei Animation)</h3>
<p>When a sparring match is interrupted to search for missing Dragon Balls, Goku and Vegeta find themselves fighting a ghost from Planet Vegeta's past in the form of Broly. But while they had the upperhand at the start, Broly adapts, not just to their fighting styles, but also their strength, and grows exponentionally stronger as the fight goes on, eventually forcing Goku and Vegeta to resort to Fusion to best him. Dragon Ball Super: Broly retains everything that makes Dragon Ball what it is today, nearly 40 minutes of non-stop fighting with a simple, yet effective story backing it up, all coupled with some of the best animation the series has seen so far, with a satisfying conclusion to boot.</p>

<h3>#1: How To Train Your Dragon 2(DreamWorks)</h3>
<p>After establishing peace between humans and dragons, Hiccup's life is thrown for a loop when a mysterious figure approaches him one fateful day, the first in a series of domino effects that would lead him to not only meeting his long lost mother, but coming face to face with a power-hungry, war-mongering Dragon Master known as Drago the Bludvist. Hiccup's resolve as future chief is put to the test and the peace he fought so hard to make a reality hangs in this balance with all of its heartbreak and doubts. How to Train Your Dragons 2 is nothing short of a masterpiece in the How to Train Your Dragon Trilogy,</p>
